# Silverstripe Schema Manager

Structured-data management for Silverstripe CMS 6.

Schema Manager combines CMS-managed site information with automatic page schema and a request-scoped registry. Schema.org entities are emitted as a single linked JSON-LD `@graph` in the page `<head>`.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.3+
- Silverstripe CMS 6

## Installation

```bash
composer require dorsetdigital/silverstripe-schema-manager
vendor/bin/sake dev/build flush=1
```

## What is automatic?

By default Schema Manager adds site, page and breadcrumb schema to normal `ContentController` page requests:

```text
Organization
    ↑ publisher
WebSite
    ↑ isPartOf
WebPage

BreadcrumbList
```

Stable entity IDs are based on the canonical site/page URLs:

```text
https://example.com/#organisation
https://example.com/#website
https://example.com/about/#webpage
https://example.com/about/#breadcrumb
```

The JSON-LD is inserted automatically with Silverstripe Requirements. No template change is required.

## Automatic WebPage schema

Every normal `SiteTree` page receives a `WebPage` entity containing its URL, title, description where available, created/modified dates and a reference to the site's `WebSite` entity. No page extension is required.

## Configuration

Each automatic layer can be disabled independently:

```yaml
DorsetDigital\SchemaManager\Service\SchemaManager:
  automatic_organisation_schema: true
  automatic_website_schema: true
  automatic_webpage_schema: true
  automatic_breadcrumb_schema: true
```

## Supported schema types

Detailed examples and configuration are kept in separate documentation:

- [Site schema](docs/site-schema.md) — `Organization` and `WebSite`
- [Breadcrumbs](docs/breadcrumbs.md) — automatic and manual `BreadcrumbList`
- [FAQPage](docs/faq.md) — questions and accepted answers
- [ImageGallery](docs/image-gallery.md) — image collections and `ImageObject` metadata
- [Product](docs/product.md) — products, offers, stock and brands
- [Service](docs/service.md) — services, providers and pricing
- [JobPosting](docs/job-posting.md) — vacancies, locations and salaries
- [BlogPosting](docs/blog-posting.md) — optional Silverstripe Blog integration

Page-level typed builders link to their `WebPage` with `isPartOf` by default. When an entity is the primary subject of a dedicated page, `setMainEntityOfPage($pageURL)` promotes that relationship explicitly.

All typed builders inherit `Schema::update()`, allowing projects to add less common Schema.org properties without the module needing to model every possible field.

## Adding schema manually

Raw entities can still be registered directly:

```php
use DorsetDigital\SchemaManager\Control\SchemaRegistry;

SchemaRegistry::addEntity(
    'https://example.com/#service',
    [
        '@type' => 'Service',
        '@id' => 'https://example.com/#service',
        'name' => 'Example service',
    ]
);
```

If an entity is registered again using the same `@id`, its data is recursively merged with the existing entity.

Typed schema objects can also be registered:

```php
SchemaRegistry::add($schema);
```

where `$schema` extends `DorsetDigital\SchemaManager\Model\Schema\Schema`.

## Extension point

The registry API can be called directly from application code; an extension hook is not required. For reusable integrations that need to contribute schema automatically to arbitrary pages, Schema Manager also calls this Silverstripe extension hook before page entities are registered:

```php
updateSchemaManagerEntities(array &$entities)
```

Extensions can therefore append, remove or modify typed schema objects without replacing the registry or controller integration. This is primarily an integration mechanism rather than a requirement for ordinary project code.

For example:

```php
use SilverStripe\Core\Extension;

class MyPageSchemaExtension extends Extension
{
    public function updateSchemaManagerEntities(array &$entities): void
    {
        // Add another Schema object, or update an existing one.
    }
}
```

The same hook is called on `SiteConfig` for site-wide entities.

The bundled Blog integration uses this mechanism, so it also provides a reference implementation for future module integrations.

## Registry API

### `SchemaRegistry::add(Schema $schema)`

Registers a typed schema object. It can be called directly from controllers or other application code. Relationships are resolved when the graph is rendered, so schemas registered independently still participate in automatic `WebPage.mainEntity` and breadcrumb relationship resolution.

### `SchemaRegistry::addEntity(string $id, array $data)`

Registers a raw Schema.org entity. Existing data under the same ID is recursively merged, including entities previously registered as typed schemas with `add()`. This allows project code to augment a typed entity without replacing it.

### `SchemaRegistry::addFAQ(string $question, string $answer, ?string $pageURL = null)`

Deprecated compatibility helper for adding FAQ questions. New code should use `FAQPageSchema` and `SchemaRegistry::add()`.

### `SchemaRegistry::addBreadCrumbs(SiteTree $page, int $maxDepth = 20, bool|string $stopAtPageType = false, bool $showHidden = false)`

Adds a `BreadcrumbList` using Silverstripe's standard breadcrumb hierarchy. The method remains available when automatic breadcrumb schema is disabled.

### `SchemaRegistry::getGraph(): array`

Returns all registered entities.

### `SchemaRegistry::getSchema(): array`

Returns the complete structure containing `@context` and `@graph`.

### `SchemaRegistry::getJSON(): string`

Returns JSON suitable for an `application/ld+json` script element.

### `SchemaRegistry::flush(): void`

Clears the request registry.

## Documentation

The `docs/` directory contains the detailed guides for each supported schema type. The README is intentionally focused on installation, automatic behaviour, configuration and the common registry API.

## Project structure

```text
_config/
  schema-manager.yml
src/
  Control/
    SchemaRegistry.php
  Extension/
    BlogPostSchemaExtension.php
    SchemaControllerExtension.php
    SiteConfigSchemaExtension.php
  Model/
    Schema/
      BlogPostingSchema.php
      FAQPageSchema.php
      ImageGallerySchema.php
      JobPostingSchema.php
      OrganisationSchema.php
      ProductSchema.php
      Schema.php
      ServiceSchema.php
      WebPageSchema.php
      WebsiteSchema.php
  Service/
    SchemaManager.php
```

The module is deliberately split into small responsibilities:

- **schema classes** build individual Schema.org entities
- **the registry** collects, merges and renders the graph
- **Silverstripe extensions** decide which entities should be registered for a request

This keeps the public API small while leaving room for additional schema types and project-specific extensions.
